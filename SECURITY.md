## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately via email:

Email: boundary6@icloud.com

For non-sensitive security-related questions (e.g., hardening suggestions), feel free to open a public issue.

As this is a solo-maintained project, response time may vary, but I will do my best to reply promptly.
